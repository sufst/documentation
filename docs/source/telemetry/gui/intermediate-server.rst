Intermediate Server 
===================

This page houses all documentation for the team's **intermediate server**. 

.. note:: This project is currently *under development* and it maintained over at GitHub. The link to the repository can be found `here <https://github.com/sufst/intermediate-server>`_.


1. Project Purpose
##################

The main purpose of the Intermediate Server is to act as an *middle man* between the car and the team's Telemetry GUI & Back-End server. 

- Project Priority: **HIGH**

.. note:: Although not 100% crusial for the car to run - meaning that the car can run in competition without a intermediate server - this project is marked as **crusial**. Without an intermediate server, the entire telemetry system stack will not work and thus no telemetry data will be available to the team. 

2. Development
##############

All code and project management resources for this project are hosted on the `GitHub <https://github.com/sufst/intermediate-server>`_ repository. 

Contributions to the codebase by team members need to follow the team's General GitHub Contributing Guidelines available :ref:`intermediate server <inter_server>`
