Documentation
=============

The SUFST documentation is built using `Sphinx
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ and is hosted using `Read the Docs
<https://readthedocs.org/>`_ using the `Furo <https://pradyunsg.me/furo/>`_
theme.

Sphinx is a tool that takes markup written in `reStructuredText
<https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`_ and can generate static ``HTML``
files to be hosted; in our case, on Read the Docs.

The markup itself is hosted in a `GitHub repository
<https://github.com/sufst/documentation>`_ and when changes are pushed to the
``main`` branch, the live site on Read the Docs will update automatically after
a few minutes.

Details about specific aspects of our documentation can be found on the
sub-pages on the left.
