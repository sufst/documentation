***********************************
Accumulator Management System (AMS)
***********************************

Description
###########
The AMS serves multiple purposes in the car. Firstly it manages the accumulator during the charging process to ensure that all the cells charge evenly and that their State Of Charge (SOC) remains as close to all the other cells as possible. Secondly it provides voltage and temperature measurements on the cells in the accumulator. The number and distribution of cells that we monitor is defined in section EV 5.8 of the `FSG Rules <https://www.formulastudent.de/fileadmin/user_upload/all/2020/rules/FS-Rules_2020_V1.0.pdf>`_. The AMS we use is the `Orion BMS 2 <https://www.orionbms.com/products/orion-bms-standard/>`_.

Accessories
###########
* We have purchased two `thermistor expansion modules <https://www.orionbms.com/products/thermistor-expansion-module/>`_ from Orion in order to monitor the temperature of enough cells in accordance with the regulations.
* A `CANdapter <https://www.ewertenergy.com/products.php?item=candapter>`_ is required to interface with a PC (Not yet purchased)
