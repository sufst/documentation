Tractive System Active Light (TSAL)
===================================

**Description** The purpose of the TSAL is to provide a visual indicator as to whether the tractive system is active or not.
There are three possible states for the TSAL:
* **Active** Red and flashing between 2 and 5 *Hz*
* **Inactive** Green and continuously illuminated
* **Off** When the Low Voltage System (LVS) is switched off, the TSAL may be fully off
