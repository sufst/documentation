Tractive System Active Light (TSAL)
===================================

**Description**
###############
The purpose of the TSAL is to provide a visual indicator as to whether the tractive system is active or not. 
Relevant rules can be found in section 4.10 of the `FSG Rules <https://www.formulastudent.de/fileadmin/user_upload/all/2020/rules/FS-Rules_2020_V1.0.pdf>`_.
There are three possible states for the TSAL:

* **Active**: Red and flashing between 2 and 5 *Hz* 
* **Inactive**: Green and continuously illuminated
* **Off**: When the Low Voltage System (LVS) is switched off, the TSAL may be fully off
